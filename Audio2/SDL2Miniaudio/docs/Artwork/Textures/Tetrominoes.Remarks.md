# How to decompose the tetrominoes in Inkscape
Not completely sure how I managed to decompoes the tetrominoes into individual stones. I think you have to select the tetrominoe and then Pfad->Kombinieren.
However, it does not always work that way. But still, I managed to decompose some of the tetrominoes.
One of the decomposed stones can then be exported as png. The I created a copy of this file and colored it with the other colors, using the pipette tool and a hex to rgb converter. Rather tedious...
